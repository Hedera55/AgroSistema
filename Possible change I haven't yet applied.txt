Ok, we need to change some things. 

The client needs to be able to do some more things...

Here's a couple functions we're enabling to clients:
They can change the information on campos and lotes. They can add kml, change hectacres ammount, and everything.

They can add products to the catalogs, and have all available functions in the galpón virtual.

They cannot change things in orders. Those are just managed by the admin.

And... a client only sees their own client dashboard. Different from an admin, who can see various clients dashboards.


. . . . . .. 

Retroactively changing how much an expenditure cost or who paid for it.
Como si fuera un excel que le podés cambiar los datos, este programa también debería poder.
