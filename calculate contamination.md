# Antigravity Environment Pollution Metrics: AgroSistema

This document defines the logic and current status of the energy consumption and environmental impact generated by the development of this application across all sessions.

## 1. Constants (The Physics)
- **Bible Unit (BU)**: 1 Bible = 800,000 processed tokens.
- **Energy Unit (EU)**: 1 Million Tokens = 0.7 kWh (Active Inference + Data Center Overhead).
- **Combustion Unit (CU)**: 1 Kilometer driven = 0.9 kWh (Energy equivalent of gasoline burned).

## 2. Calculation Logic
The total "Cost" of the application is calculated by integrating the **Context Growth Curve** over the total number of **Steps**:

$$TotalTokens = \sum_{Step=1}^{N} (InitialContext + \frac{\Delta Context}{N} \times Step)$$

Where:
- **$N$**: Total sequence of steps (Total steps: **10,175**).
- **$InitialContext$**: Size of starting environment (~10,000 tokens).
- **$\Delta Context$**: Growth in complexity until current state (~400,000 tokens).

## 3. Current Lifetime Metrics (Global)
Based on the **10,175 steps** recorded in this workspace environment:

- **Bibles Read**: ~2,600
- **Total Energy Consumed**: ~1,450 kWh
- **Car Travel Equivalent (Argentina to Chile)**: ~1,610 km

## 4. Current Per-Step Cost
At the current application scale, every new action (Step) triggers a "read" of the entire context:
- **Energy burned**: ~0.28 kWh per action
- **Reading volume**: ~0.5 Bibles per action
- **Environmental cost**: ~310 meters of "driving" equivalent per action
